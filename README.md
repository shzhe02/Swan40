## Swan40

A custom 40-key split keyboard. Heavily inspired by the Ferris Sweep and Corne

Notable features:
- Uses Choc v1 switches and corresponding Kailh hotswap sockets.
- Built around the XIAO nRF52840 (**not the sense version**)
- Massive potential battery capacity due to unique controller mounting position.
- Runs on ZMK
